            <h4>The Ridge Shimla</h4>
        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="information" id="information">
        <div class="content">
            <p>Swathed by cedar, rhododendron, fir and Himalayan oak trees, the state capital of Himachal Pradesh is one
                of the most popular hill stations of India. Basking in the grandeur of the British era with apparent
                influences in its architecture, Shimla did charm the British colonisers of the 19th century so much that
                they elevated the small township into the summer capital of an empire sprawling the sub-continent.</p>
            <p>In its heyday Shimla attracted princes, merchants, diplomats and political leaders from Afghanistan,
                Tibet, China, Myanmar and other countries. Several heritage buildings in the city are witness to
                historical moments that have shaped the history of south Asia.</p>
            <p>Leaders of the freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, C.
                Rajagopalachari and others frequently visited Shimla in their struggle to gain independence from British
                rule. Hard contested deliberations over the partition of India and Pakistan at Viceregal Lodge, now the
                Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, between the resident Viceroy and leaders of the freedom struggle
                finally won the country its Independence on 15th August, 1947.</p>
            <p>An engineering marvel, the Kalka-Shimla railway line with 102 tunnels constructed between 1898 to 1903
                has been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage mountain railway site. The Ridge and The Mall are still
                popular landmarks just as they were in the pre-Independence era. The imperial Viceregal Lodge, the
                graceful Christ Church, Gaiety Theatre, Gorton Castle, Barnes Court and several buildings are part of
                the colonial architectural heritage of the town.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Languages spoken:</strong> English and Hindi are the dominant languages spoken in Shimla. A
                sizeable minority does speak Punjabi. In addition to these several native dialects of Pahari language
                are also spoken by the residents of the area.</p>
            <p><strong>Clothing essentials:</strong> Bearing a temperate climate, cotton clothes with light woolens are
                worn from April to October. Heavy woollends and jackets are required for the winter which starts to set
                in from November and lasts upto March. In spring and autumn thin sweaters and hoodies are needed to beat
                the morning and evening chills.

            <h3><strong>Shali Tibba</strong></h3>
            <p>At an altitude of 2,872 meters, the mountain top Shali Tibba Temple has a 360 degree view of the high
                peaks around and the deep valleys in the foreground. Dedicated to goddess Bhima Kali, the divine place
                can only be reached after a gruelling uphill trek from Khatnol village. To reach Khatnol one can board a
                local bus or hire a taxi. From Shimla to Khatnol the road distance is 45 km.</p>

            <h3><strong>Naldehra</strong></h3>
            <p>A vast expansive meadow surrounded by a dark deodar forest has enchanted travellers and residents for
                generations. Lord Curzon, the viceroy of India from 1898 to 1905, even named his daughter Naldehra after
                this scenic spot. The place has a 18-hole golf course. A nature walk which traverses uphill, offers very
                scenic views that are complemented by the emulsifying fragrance of the woods and bird chirpings. There
                is a frequent local bus service to Naldehra and taxis can also be hired. From the city Naldehra is 23
                kms away.</p>

            <h3><strong>Hatu Peak, Narkanda</strong></h3>
            <p>Towering over Sutlej valley, Hatu Peak at 3400 meters altitude is one of the highest peaks among the
                hills near Shimla. Though a motorable road has been constructed, but an uphill walk through the woods
                from Narkanda is a better experience of the hills. Atop the mountain, a temple dedicated to demon
                slaying goddess Kali exhibits the local architecture and wood craftsmanship skills. The 360 degree views
                from the mountain top are deep and expansive making the trek a worthy one. A level walk through a dense
                oak forest opens onto Jaw Bagh, an alpine meadow, which only adds to the scenic value of the getaway. To
                reach Hatu, one has to do a road journey to Narkanda, a distance of 64 km from Shimla. From Narkanda one
                needs to take a taxi or do a 8 km trek through forest country to the mountain top destination.</p>

                complex stands out for its architectural brilliance. Located in the heart of scenic Sarahan, the place
                has a up close view of perennially snow covered towering peaks. The temple is a highly revered one and

                paddy fields and almond orchards is a very scenic place. There is also a stone temple complex dedicated
                to the warrior Goddess Durga built with local materials in an architectural style typical of the valley.

                to drop and pick up passengers. Taxis can be availed from Shimla or Rohru to get to Hatkoti.</p>
